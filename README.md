# README for MAR-YOLOv9: Agricultural Object Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of "MAR-YOLOv9: A Multi-Adapt Recognition-YOLOv9 Method for Cross-Dataset Agricultural Object Detection".     MAR-YOLOv9 is a lightweight, high-performance object detection model designed specifically for agricultural applications.     It leverages the power of YOLOv9 and introduces several innovative improvements to adapt to the complexities and variability of agricultural environments.
